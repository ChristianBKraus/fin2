== New Financials

A sequence of microservices communicating via Kafka

=== Running the app:

Go to the root of the repository.

`docker-compose up -d`

`./mvnw clean package`

Go to every root of the modules and start every service

`start.bat`

Start the producer in the root directory

`produce.bat`

Type some arbitrary product name and enter.

You can follow the transformation in the console of every service

Once you are done, stop the Kafka cluster: `docker-compose down`
